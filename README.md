## About Me

I am a student pursuing computer networking with a passion for designing and implementing network solutions. I enjoy learning about different network topologies and protocols, and I love building networks that are efficient, secure, and reliable.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- [Project 1]Packet Tracer Simulation
Scenario: You are tasked with setting up a network for a small business that has two departments: sales and accounting. Each department has 10 employees and they need to be able to share files and printers. The network should also have internet access and be secure.

Solution:

Create a new network topology in Packet Tracer.
Add two switches to the topology and connect them with a crossover cable.
Add two routers to the topology and connect them to the switches using straight-through cables.
Configure the routers with appropriate IP addresses and subnet masks.
Configure one router to act as the gateway for the sales department and the other router to act as the gateway for the accounting department.
Connect each department's computers to their respective switch and configure them with IP addresses in their department's subnet.
Configure the routers to allow communication between the two departments.
Configure the routers to allow internet access for both departments.
Configure each department's computers to use their respective router as the default gateway.
Configure file sharing and printer sharing on the computers.
Configure security measures such as firewall rules and access control lists to protect the network from unauthorized access.
With this setup, the sales and accounting departments can communicate with each other and share files and printers. They can also access the internet while keeping the network secure.
